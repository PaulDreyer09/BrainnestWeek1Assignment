                <h3>Planche Lean</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The Planche Lean is a basic pushup style form where you lay on the floor flat on your stomach, with your
                hands placed on the floor next to your hips.<br>
                You then push your body up like a pushup until fully extended. <br />
                You let your body lean forward, letting your scapular muscles activate which helps your body understand
                the type of balance it should focus on that will help in balancing during a full planche and other
                variations.

                <h3>Frog Stand</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The Frog stand requires you to follow up on the planche lean by bringing up each knee and locking it
                behind your elbow while keeping your body leaning slightly forward.

                <h3>Tuck Planche</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The Tuck Planche builds up upon the frog stand by removing the assisted balance from locking your knees
                and elbows and letting the knees hang between the elbows.
                This requires you to keep the same forward leaning form but activating your core to assist in keeping
                the form

                <h3>Straddle Planche</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The straddle planche is an advanced form of the planche, where you straighten out your back from the
                tuck planche position, activating all the core muscles, arm muscles and scapular muscles, requiring
                focus to maintain the balance and plenty of practise for the body to understand the form.<br />
                The straddle planche requires you to spread out your legs for a wider balance, making it slightly easier
                than the full planche.

                <h3>Planche</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The full planche is the final step, requiring you to no longer using assisted balance by bringing your
                legs together, having all the balance work doen by your focus on keeping all the muslces activated.
